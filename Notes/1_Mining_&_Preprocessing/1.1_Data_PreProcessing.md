- **Box-Cox Transformation:** To stabilize variance and make data more normal distribution-like.
#### **Advantages:** Increases the interpretability and effectiveness of the model.
#### **Disadvantages:** Transformed features may become less interpretable.

### **2.2 Data Normalization**
#### **Overview:** Scaling numerical features to a specific range (e.g., [0, 1]).
#### **When to Use:** When working with models sensitive to feature scales (e.g., SVM, KNN).
#### **Methods:**
- **Min-Max Scaling:** Scaling data to a fixed range (0-1).
- **Z-Score Normalization:** Standardizing data (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1).
#### **Advantages:** Improves convergence in optimization algorithms.
#### **Disadvantages:** Sensitive to outliers, as scaling affects all data points.

### **2.3 Data Discretization**
#### **Overview:** Converting continuous data into discrete categories.
#### **When to Use:** To reduce the number of distinct values in features.
#### **Methods:**
- **Equal-Width Binning:** Dividing data into intervals of equal width.
- **Equal-Frequency Binning:** Dividing data into intervals with an equal number of records.
#### **Advantages:** Makes data easier to understand and work with in models like decision trees.
#### **Disadvantages:** May lose information during binning.

### **2.4 Encoding Categorical Variables**
#### **Overview:** Converting categorical variables into numeric values.
#### **When to Use:** For algorithms that require numerical inputs.
#### **Techniques:**
- **Label Encoding:** Assigning a unique integer to each category.
- **One-Hot Encoding:** Creating binary columns for each category.
- **Ordinal Encoding:** Assigning an ordered value to categories (e.g., low, medium, high).
#### **Advantages:** Allows for the use of categorical data in numeric models.
#### **Disadvantages:** One-hot encoding can lead to a large number of features.

### **2.5 Handling Imbalanced Data**
#### **Overview:** Modifying the dataset when class distribution is uneven (common in classification problems).
#### **When to Use:** When dealing with imbalanced classes (e.g., fraud detection).
#### **Methods:**
- **Oversampling:** Duplicating instances of the minority class (e.g., SMOTE).
- **Undersampling:** Reducing the size of the majority class.
- **Class Weighting:** Giving higher weights to minority classes in model training.
#### **Advantages:** Helps improve model performance on minority classes.
#### **Disadvantages:** Oversampling may cause overfitting, and undersampling may lose information.

## **3. Data Reduction**
### **3.1 Feature Selection**
#### **Overview:** Selecting the most relevant features for model building.
#### **When to Use:** To improve model efficiency and reduce overfitting.
#### **Methods:**
- **Filter Methods:** Based on statistical tests (e.g., chi-square, correlation).
- **Wrapper Methods:** Based on model performance (e.g., Recursive Feature Elimination).
- **Embedded Methods:** Feature selection built into algorithms (e.g., LASSO, Random Forest).
#### **Advantages:** Reduces dimensionality and computation time.
#### **Disadvantages:** Risk of excluding important features.

### **3.2 Dimensionality Reduction**
#### **Overview:** Reducing the number of features while retaining as much information as possible.
#### **When to Use:** When dealing with large datasets with many features.
#### **Methods:**
